Socket programming is extremely difficult, I dont know if anyone has mentioned, but dude this stuff doesnt make any sense

i need to fix the client first before i can fix the server because i can only connect with `nc`
unless i dont i think i can probably fix the server while only able to use `nc`
i dont really know as a matter of fact. it is 10:20 pm and i cannot sleep so i think ill do some documentation and a little bit of programming
